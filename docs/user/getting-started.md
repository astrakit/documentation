## Creating an Account
When launching the app for the first time, you'll be prompted to either **log in or register**. Just press the register option and let the app guide you through the registration process.

## Securing Your Account
Make sure to use **2FA authentication** and a **strong password**. Both can be set up in your Astrakit settings.

## Securing Your Data
We handle most of the work to secure your data, but there are standard data protection procedures we recommend following:

1. **Regular Backups**: Ensure you regularly back up your data to prevent data loss.
2. **Encryption**: Use encryption to protect sensitive information both in transit and at rest.
3. **Access Controls**: Limit access to your data to only those who need it.
4. **Software Updates**: Keep your software up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.
5. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor your systems for any unusual activity.

By following these procedures, you can help ensure that your data remains secure.
