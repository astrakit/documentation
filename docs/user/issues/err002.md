# ERR002 (Unencrypted)
This error occurs because the certificates used for the connection are not valid. When certificates are invalid, the connection cannot be encrypted properly, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Ensuring that the certificates are valid and correctly configured is essential for establishing a secure, encrypted connection.
