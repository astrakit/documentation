# Security notice (15/03/2025)

Astrakit takes security seriously. We only collect minimal data about you, such as your username, email, password, and other data automatically collected by our systems (e.g., IP address). We do not track any other data about you.

## Security Measures

We implement various security measures to protect your data, including encryption and regular security audits. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## Data Storage and Security

Our servers are hosted in Germany and operated by Datalix. We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of your data. When you send images or any content, it is saved on our servers, but the image still belongs to the original license author of the image.

## Legal Disclaimer

Astrakit is not responsible for any damage or loss resulting from the use of our app. Users are not allowed to engage in illegal activities, including but not limited to the illegal trade of money, using our app.
