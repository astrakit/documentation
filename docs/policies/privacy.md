# Privacy policy (15/03/2025)

Astrakit is committed to protecting your privacy. We only collect minimal data about you, such as your username, email, password, and other data automatically collected by our systems (e.g., IP address). We do not track any other data about you.

## Data Collection and Usage

We collect the following data:
- Username
- Email address
- Password
- IP address and other data automatically collected by our systems

This data is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving our services. We do not sell or share your data with third parties, except as required by law.

## Data Storage and Security

Our servers are hosted in Germany and operated by Datalix. We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of your data. When you send images or any content, it is saved on our servers, but the image still belongs to the original license author of the image.

## Encryption and Privacy

We use strong encryption techniques to protect your data and ensure your privacy. All communications between users are encrypted end-to-end, meaning that only the sender and the recipient can read the messages. Our staff cannot read any private messages or content sent by users, except for content in groups or servers where staff members are present as users.

## Security Disclaimer

Even though we strive to use the best security practices and encryption techniques, we cannot guarantee security at all times. Like any other website, there is always a risk of a security breach. We continuously work to improve our security measures, but we cannot ensure absolute security.

## User Rights

You have the right to access, rectify, and erase your data. You also have the right to restrict processing, data portability, and to object to the processing of your data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at contact@astrakit.cc.

## Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services to help us provide and improve our services. These third parties may have access to your data only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes.
